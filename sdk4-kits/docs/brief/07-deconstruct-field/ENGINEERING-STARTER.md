# Deconstruct Field Engineering Starter

Read PRD.md and ../ENGINEERING-FOUNDATION.md before implementing. This is an algorithm and integration plan, not a verified manifest schema. Proposed controls must be adapted to confirmed SDK keys and units.

## Baseline and first implementation task

REFERENCE.png is the delivered genuine WebGL render. PROTOTYPE.frag explains its current procedural construction and is disposable starting code. Remove hardcoded palette, standalone #version/entrypoint assumptions and display gamma conversion before SDK integration. Do not assume current endpoint or performance approval. First create the smallest SDK-native hero that compiles, renders and has one visible form control and one visible periodic motion control.

## Mathematical construction

Analytic rectangle/arc/line fields with explicit layer order. A layout grammar defines stable element IDs, anchor relationships and collision allowances. Use a consistent coordinate system for resizing and aspect ratios.

Write the scene's field class beside its function and derive any required bound. Keep static seed-derived offsets separate from loop phase. Position, normal, material and visibility calculations use the same deformed domain so highlights follow the geometry.

## Renderer and layer decomposition

Single full-resolution analytic SDF pass for crisp graphics; optional separate restrained depth/shadow pass. Use derivative-based edge widths where permitted; fixed pixel widths otherwise. Prefer actual layering to full-screen noisy overlays.

Layer stack:

1. Ground: palette background with controlled depth/color separation.
2. Form: project-specific analytic geometry or field, with stable seeded identities.
3. Material: authored response matching the PRD; separate surface and emission terms.
4. Light: coherent key and restrained rim, plus justified occlusion/shadow approximation.
5. Atmosphere: only where it clarifies depth; zero density is a valid control endpoint.
6. Finish: tone map once, restrained bloom where emissive, full-resolution output edges.
7. Motion: shared bounded phase and project-specific closed trajectories.

For the hardest renderer choice, prototype two options at equal render scale and compare silhouette stability, detail and measured cost. Select on evidence rather than technique prestige.

## Loop construction

Staggered translation and rotation through an in-hold-out-return schedule. Each plane returns to its initial transform and velocity; subordinate grids respond to their parent plane. Do not randomly regenerate the composition on wrap.

Use theta=2*pi*fract(u_p). Parameterized temporal frequency is integer. A fixed fractional static angle is allowed; a fractional complete rotation over the loop is not. If a bounded excursion is intended, use a periodic oscillator instead. Make endpoint position and derivative tests for each motion path. Preserve all stable IDs through wrapping and fades. No linear unbounded time or mutable random stream.

## Proposed project controls

Values are initial look-development hypotheses, not validated final bounds. Scene distances are normalized units; px controls are explicit screen-space widths. Integer spatial counts are distinct from integer temporal cycle counts.

| Control | Type | Initial range | Hero default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plane count | int | 6–28 | 14 |
| Arc radius | float | 0.1–0.65 | 0.35 |
| Grid spacing | float | 0.015–0.12 | 0.04 |
| Line width px | float | 0.7–3 | 1.2 |
| Layer separation | float | 0–0.15 | 0.05 |
| Offset amplitude | float | 0–0.35 | 0.12 |
| Rotation amplitude | float | 0–0.5 | 0.12 |
| Hold fraction | float | 0.1–0.6 | 0.3 |
| Recompositions per loop | int | 1–3 | 1 |

Add shared key direction, exposure, bloom and quality only where useful and within the base parameter budget. Quality/structural selectors use mutate:0. Do not add reserved host parameters. Tie every control to one named stage and render min/default/max evidence; remove any ineffective control.

## Quality and performance approach

Provide Live and Export settings with the same phase, seed and composition. Live reduces scene scale, sample count and subordinate detail before changing the primary form. Export raises resolution and sampling without changing brightness. Do not multiply emission by quality. Bound scene work and early-out rays. Record total nested iterations/fetches before validating; stay under half of playbook hard limits.

Measure on real hardware using the shared method. The supplied stills were software-rendered and are not performance evidence. If the selected algorithm misses the live target, compare a cheaper form-preserving renderer before cutting the scene's identity.

## Project-specific failure tests

Dead parameters, arbitrary layout and disappearing edge detail; fine grids need a distance/scale-aware attenuation policy.

Mandatory targeted checks: Main silhouette is legible in monochrome; layouts differ structurally across variants; no geometry or controls are clipped in portrait, square or landscape. Also compare the hero with material/atmosphere disabled to reveal whether structure survives independently. Compare deterministic frame hashes or pixel deltas under nonsequential seeking. Cover seed and parameter extremes, especially structural thresholds that can cause discontinuities.

## Implementation sequence

1. Verify installed SDK manifest, helpers and graph contract; run its bundled example.
2. Build ground/form only and render phase 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.
3. Implement closed hero and secondary motion; test seam and velocity before adding effects.
4. Add coherent material/light/depth; calibrate exposure at min/max quality.
5. Bind proposed controls and authored palettes, then prove each control visually.
6. Complete Live/Export branches; measure device cost and run worst-case flash/pop audit.
7. Create eight derivatives with approved fingerprints; rerun QA for every entry.
8. Pack the SDK kit, build the animated product page and inspect films and stills.

## Expected source layout

Use the SDK's actual filename and manifest conventions after discovery. Organize source conceptually into kit metadata, shared field/material/motion helpers, nine style implementations, palette presets and QA evidence. Keep generated build output out of reusable source. Exact paths from the playbook are examples, not guaranteed in the recipient's repository.

## Completion evidence

Deliver the .motifkit and source with validated contract map, field-class/bound notes, pass plan, loop/pops/flash results, exposure comparisons, per-control captures, device timings and known approximations. State whether every gate passed; an unavailable check remains unverified. Include two alternative renderer/look directions only if they clarify a remaining tradeoff.
